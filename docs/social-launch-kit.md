# Social Launch Kit: The Logocentric Architecture

**Strategy:** Do not announce a "job search." Announce a "Paradigm Shift." You are not asking for work; you are demonstrating how you have already done the work.

**Headline:**
Why I treat Governance as Art: The Logocentric Architecture of a 91-Repo Ecosystem.

**Body:**
Most technical systems fail not because of bad syntax, but because of poor narrative coherence. 

If an orchestration layer lacks "rhetorical awareness," it collapses under scale. If a state machine doesn't have a clear "character arc," it becomes buggy.

I spent the last 12 months building the **Eight-Organ System**—an automated, self-governing ecosystem of 91 repositories and ~400K words of documentation. 

I didn't just build it; I architected the "Constitution" that governs it.

Today, I’m launching a new portfolio that proves how MFA-level Narrative Theory translates directly into Production-Grade Engineering.

I’ve built 4 distinct "Masks" to translate this complexity for different partners:
1. **AI Systems Engineer**: For labs needing safe, scalable agent swarms.
2. **Systems Architect**: For teams needing rigorous hexagonal backends.
3. **Creative Technologist**: For R&D at the edge of code and culture.
4. **Technical PM**: For leadership that bridges the gap.

Check the **Architecture Page** to see the live dependency graph of what I've built. 

If you are building systems where "Meaning" matters as much as "Function," we should talk.

**Post 1:**
I built a symbolic operating system in Python to prove that "Narrative" is a computable primitive. 

It has 1,254 tests and 85% coverage.

Today I'm opening the "Front Door" to the Eight-Organ System.

**Post 2 (Thread):**
2,000 applications taught me one thing:
High-dimensional polymaths get filtered by low-dimensional hiring algorithms.

So I engineered a solution.
I built a "Persona Router" that translates my 91-repo ecosystem into 4 market-legible signals.

**Post 3:**
- Staff AI Engineer (The Orchestrator)
- Systems Architect (The Structuralist)
- Creative Technologist (The Artist)
- Technical PM (The Governor)
