      <h2>The Idea</h2>
      <p>
        Location-based games overlay generic mechanics onto real geography. TurfSynth AR goes further: your actual neighborhood — its streets, landmarks, density, terrain — procedurally generates the game world around you. Walk past a park and it becomes a resource zone. Live near a dense commercial strip and the game plays differently than if you're in a suburban cul-de-sac. The real world isn't the backdrop; it's the level designer.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>TypeScript monorepo</strong> (Node.js 20+, pnpm workspaces) with geospatial data processing at its core. The system ingests OpenStreetMap data and municipal datasets to build a typed geographic model. A procedural generation engine converts real-world features into game mechanics: building density affects resource availability, road networks define movement corridors, points of interest become strategic objectives. The AR layer renders game state onto camera feeds using device sensors for positioning. A territory control system tracks player-claimed zones with real geographic boundaries.
      </p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Most location-based games treat geography as a random number generator for spawn points. TurfSynth treats it as a design parameter — the game should feel different in Brooklyn than in rural Montana because those places <em>are</em> different. The procedural generation from real geospatial data is the technical challenge; the design insight is that meaningful location-awareness produces gameplay that feels personal rather than generic. This is ORGAN-III commercial product design grounded in ORGAN-I's theoretical approach to context-aware systems.
