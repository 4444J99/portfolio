      <h2>The Idea</h2>
      <p>
        What if a live performance weren't scripted by a single director but shaped in real time by collective audience input — while performers retained expressive override authority? The Omni-Dromenon Engine is a real-time audience-participatory performance system where weighted consensus algorithms transform crowd decisions into artistic direction. It's not "Twitch Plays" chaos. It's structured collaboration with governance.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        The engine is a TypeScript + Python hybrid system built as a pnpm monorepo. Audience members submit inputs through a web interface; a consensus module aggregates and weights those inputs according to configurable trust and participation metrics. Performers see the collective direction but can override it — the override is itself a recorded artistic decision. The system handles real-time WebSocket communication, state synchronization across participants, and a performance timeline that captures every decision (audience and performer) as an auditable event log.
      </p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        This is ORGAN-II at its most ambitious — art that treats its own governance as part of the aesthetic. The consensus algorithms aren't backstage plumbing; they're the medium. Who gets weighted more? What happens when the crowd and the performer disagree? These are artistic questions answered by system design. The engine consumes theoretical foundations from ORGAN-I (the recursive-engine's identity models inform how performers and audience maintain coherence across transformations) and produces a framework that could become a commercial product in ORGAN-III.
