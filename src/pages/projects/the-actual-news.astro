      <h2>The Idea</h2>
      <p>
        What if the platform itself made truthfulness the product? Not fact-checking after publication, but a native architecture where every published story ships with a machine-readable verification spine: atomic claims with confidence scores, content-addressed evidence graphs with provenance chains, and append-only correction history. Publication is gated by deterministic quality policies — not engagement metrics, not editorial discretion. If a story doesn't meet the evidence threshold, it doesn't publish. Period.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>TypeScript microservice architecture</strong> with five services (Gateway, Story, Claim, Evidence, Verify), a Next.js frontend, and PostgreSQL storage. Every story has three layers: the <strong>Narrative</strong> (human-readable), the <strong>Claims Ledger</strong> (typed atomic statements with confidence scores and support status), and the <strong>Evidence Graph</strong> (content-addressed objects linked by typed, weighted edges). The publish gate is a single transactional SQL query evaluating primary evidence ratio, unsupported claim share, contradicted claims, and high-impact corroboration — all thresholds externalized into versioned policy packs. Seven conformance tests (CT-01 through CT-07) validate gate behavior against an RFC-style protocol spec with 10 hard invariants.
      </p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        The economic model follows from the architecture: if value comes from verification, not attention, then funding can decouple from clicks. The AGPL license ensures any deployment shares its source — a platform built on transparency should itself be transparent. Corrections are first-class immutable events, not quiet edits. Policy-as-code means a local civic newsroom and a national investigative platform can share the same engine with different quality thresholds. This is journalism infrastructure that takes its own principles seriously enough to encode them as invariants.
