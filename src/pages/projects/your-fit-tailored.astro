      <h2>The Idea</h2>
      <p>
        What if you never shopped for clothes again? Not "auto-replenishment" — a fundamentally different relationship with apparel. A curated box of outfits arrives every week. You wear the items, return last week's box, and the system cleans, refurbishes, and redeploys inventory through a closed-loop pipeline. Fit confidence compounds with every cycle. Cognitive load asymptotically approaches zero.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        This is a <strong>specification-driven seed</strong> for a circular apparel platform. The design covers the full product lifecycle: user onboarding with body measurement and style profiling, an algorithmic curation engine that improves with each cycle's feedback, closed-loop logistics (pickup, clean, refurbish, redeploy), and a temporal service model where the subscription <em>is</em> the product — you don't own garments, you subscribe to a continuous wardrobe experience. The specification defines inventory management with garment lifecycle tracking, quality gates for refurbishment, and sustainability metrics (waste reduction, water savings, carbon offset) as first-class product features.
      </p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Fast fashion produces ~92 million tons of textile waste annually. Circular models reduce this, but most "rental" services add friction — returns, delays, sizing anxiety. Your Fit Tailored attacks the friction directly: the system learns your fit, your logistics are automated, and the garments cycle through a managed pipeline. The specification-driven approach means the product design is documented and testable before a single line of implementation code is written — demonstrating ORGAN-III's methodology of rigorous product specification before engineering investment.
