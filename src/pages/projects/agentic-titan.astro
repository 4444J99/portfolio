      <h2>The Idea</h2>
      <p>
        Multi-agent AI systems face a scaling problem: frameworks that work for two agents on a laptop collapse when you need 100+ agents with safety constraints, topology awareness, and production-grade observability. Agentic Titan is a polymorphic, model-agnostic orchestration framework that provides nine topology patterns, 22 agent archetypes, and the safety infrastructure to run them responsibly — from local development to Firecracker microVMs.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        The framework is <strong>Python 3.11+</strong> with 1,312 passing tests. Nine topology patterns (pipeline, fan-out, fan-in, mesh, hierarchical, ring, star, tree, custom) define how agents communicate. 22 agent archetypes provide pre-configured behavioral profiles. The safety layer includes sandboxed execution, resource limits, output validation, and audit logging. Model-agnostic design means agents can use any LLM backend (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, custom) through a unified interface. Production infrastructure includes Prometheus metrics, structured logging, health checks, and graceful degradation under load.
      </p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        This is ORGAN-IV's flagship — the orchestration organ's answer to "how do you coordinate autonomous agents at scale?" The nine topology patterns aren't academic exercises; they encode real deployment patterns discovered while building the broader eight-organ system. The framework is consumed downstream by ORGAN-III products (the Hunter Protocol in <em>in-midst-my-life</em>, the verification pipeline in <em>The Actual News</em>) and provides the governance patterns that ORGAN-IV applies across the entire system. 1,312 tests at production-hardened status means this isn't a prototype — it's infrastructure.
