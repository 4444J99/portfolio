      <h2>The Distribution Problem</h2>
<SketchContainer sketchId="scatter" height="250px" mobileHeight="180px" ariaLabel="Content distribution scatter pattern" />

      <p>
        You can build 91 repositories with 404,000 words of documentation and it means nothing if nobody encounters the work. Distribution is the most systematically underthought problem in creative technology: engineers and artists invest enormous energy in building, then treat the question of who sees the work as an afterthought — a tweet after launch, a link in a Slack channel, a conference talk if they happen to know someone on the program committee.<Cite id={1} author="Shirky, Clay" title="Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations" source="Penguin Press" year={2008} />

      <h2>The POSSE Principle</h2>
      <p>
        The distribution strategy is built on the POSSE principle: Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere. I directed the architectural commitment to long-term content ownership, where all content originates in the organ system's own repositories — the canonical source lives in infrastructure the practitioner controls — and gets syndicated outward through defined channels.<Cite id={3} author="Berners-Lee, Tim" title="Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web" source="Harper Business" year={1999} />

      <h2>Audience Segmentation</h2>
      <p>
        The distribution strategy identifies four distinct audiences, each requiring a different framing of the same underlying content. This is not a marketing persona exercise — it is a rhetorical analysis of how the same work carries different significance for different communities of practice.<Cite id={5} author="Bakhtin, Mikhail M." title="The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays" source="University of Texas Press" year={1981} />

      <h2>Channel-Native Adaptation</h2>
      <p>
        The critical distinction in this distribution strategy is between cross-posting and channel-native adaptation. Cross-posting takes a single piece of content and copies it to multiple platforms unchanged — a practice that violates the norms of every platform simultaneously. I implemented a genuine re-framing process for each channel's discourse conventions, audience expectations, and technical affordances.<Cite id={7} author="McLuhan, Marshall" title="Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man" source="McGraw-Hill" year={1964} />
      </p>

      <h2>Automated Distribution Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>
        The distribution system is not a manual checklist but an automated pipeline implemented as GitHub Actions workflows. The <code>distribute-content.yml</code> workflow extracts canonical content from the organ repositories, applies channel-specific adaptation scripts, and publishes to each target platform through authenticated API calls. Mastodon distribution was verified with HTTP 200 responses; Discord distribution was verified with HTTP 204 responses.<Cite id={1} author="Shirky, Clay" title="Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations" source="Penguin Press" year={2008} />

      <h2>Distribution as Organ: Governance Protection</h2>
      <p>
        The most unusual aspect of this project is that distribution has its own organ — ORGAN VII (Kerygma) — rather than being a feature of marketing or a task on a project board. This is not organizational vanity but a governance decision with real consequences.<Cite id={9} author="Ostrom, Elinor" title="Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action" source="Cambridge University Press" year={1990} />
      </p>

      <h2>Measuring Distribution Without Vanity Metrics</h2>
      <p>
        The distribution strategy deliberately avoids vanity metrics — follower counts, like ratios, impression numbers — in favor of metrics that indicate whether the content reached the intended audiences and served the intended purposes.<Cite id={2} author="Jenkins, Henry" title="Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide" source="NYU Press" year={2006} />
